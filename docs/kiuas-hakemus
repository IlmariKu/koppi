# What problem is your startup solving?

Entrance to universities is competitive. The admission process is changing from entrance exams to high school final exams. The challenge is thus spread out to a wider time and is dependent on deep knowledge of vast HS curriculum

Students have challenges 1) assessing and having confidence in their knowledge, 2) planning their studies to reach goals. A lot is laid on the shoulders of student. Not knowing how the exam will go, how good one currently is and is one progressing.. That's a lot of stress by itself, but with the changes the stakes are even higher.

Small portion of privileged and motivated students can pay hefty amounts for private tutoring and prep schools. This contributes to growing inequality in our society. 

The existing prep schools are struggling to translate their existing business and models to cover the complexity of whole high school. They barely scratch the surface on how technology can help the student in this path.



# Explain your product/service.


Koppi is a web-app that works on all platforms. The user-experience is simple: log in, study the recommended content, get feedback of your progression. The continuous feed of suitably challenging content with feeling that "hey, i'm progressing" is created to be motivating.

Koppi takes care of rest. It 1) maps your knowledge, 2) creates a personalize learning path from current state to the goal, and 3) gives you new and relevant study content (not too easy, not too hard, spaced repetition for recollection)

The way koppi is written allows it to be content-agnostic and extendable. The platform creates a lot of data, allowing us to guide study content creation and algorithm development through learning analytics.

# In which stage are you currently at?

2 days away from MVP launch. The gist of the features we're looking to build are present in the app, and we are ready to begin iteration with real-world clients. Right now, we're testing the app with beta-users, gathering feedback and making adjustments before releasing to the wider audience.

# How long have you been working on your startup?
4 weeks! It has been very intensive few weeks. Last 7 days where spent in isolated cabin, working the whole time to get the app ready for the Kiuas-application, which was a great "imaginary" deadline to start and move fast regarding with the MVP.

# Have you been able to validate your idea/problem somehow?
Yes. The first thing, before building anything, was to validate the problem with people who are studying and interview them about how they're studying. We both interviewed 5 people, from Facebook student groups and acquaintances. The subjects expressed difficulties regarding their scheduling and tracking their studies.

We've also dove deep into internet conversations to understand how students feel about cram-schools and studies in general. This caused the focus to shift from learning to more on personal-evaluation, digital tutoring.

# Tell us about your team and your team members' skillsets (including you). Please include links to everyone's LinkedIn profiles, if possible. If you're a solo founder, just introduce yourself.

# Something you'd like to show? (Optional)
Here's a video of us writing the application in Markus basement and saying few words, just to see what kind of dudes are writing this stuff here.

# What made you apply to Kiuas Accelerator?
The momentum. We're building the project in any-case, regardless of the Accelerator-application outcome, but we would be moving a heck of a lot faster and smarter with the advantage of being able to iterate ideas over with an established entrepreneur. Perks, connections and possibilities offered by Kiuas do also play a big motivational role regarding applying. It's a time investment well-worth.

# What do you want to get out of the program?
Higher probability to succeed as an entrepreneur. Throughout the entrepreneurial journey, there's been a lot of potholes and obstacles along the way, some of which have been succesfully dodged, others not. Due to the extreme uncertainty as an inherent part of entrepreneurship, there's no telling on how many crashes or successes we're heading towards to, but the possibility to be mentored by an entrepreneur who's succeeded, would make all of it more likely.

How did you hear about Kiuas?
From a friend.
