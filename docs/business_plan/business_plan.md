## Problem in detail
- What problem are we solving
- What are the primary pain points
- Current solutions to problem

Entrance to universities is competitive. The admission is now changing from entrance exams to high school final exams. The task is thus spread out wider - excellence in finals is vital, and is dependent on deep knowledge of the relevant HS curriculum.

How to learn this colossal amount of stuff? What to study and when? What did I truly understand? Am I just wasting my time? What do I remember and for how long? 


Current preparation course schools have not yet adapted to the current change. Most of them still rely on class-type teaching, which is not scalable. Some have made software solutions - these players are growing. The programs are rough translations of their current contents with dysmal user experience. At maximum, they repeating algorithms and simple plot showing learned topics as a function of time. New players are bringing traditional course contents to high schools. 

No solution exist that takes care of the whole high school learning process.


## Solution in detail
- Product/service to customres
- What and how
- How does this solve a problem

Koppi takes care of 
- map their knowledge
- create personalized learning pathway to reach a goal
- give new study content and repeat old topics.

The user experience for the student is simple. The student is given content to study, they rate how well they understood it. All else is taken care by our software. The student receives information of their progress. 

Course agnostic - currently covers math chemistry physics biology, can be extended to other topics.

TODO: explicitly how this solves the problem
    
##  Target market
- Market analysis, research. 
- Segmentation. TAM, SAM, and SOM
    - Total available addressable market
    - Your segmented addressable market
    - Share of market, realistic within a few years
- Ideal customer for each segment

There are 100k high school students^1. The final exams in mathematics, biology, physics, chemistry have around 40k participants. In addition, tens of thousnds (TODO: hae luku)

Our main segment are the high school students. The other major segment are people applying to universities. Whole portion of the students are addressable, but the weight would be on people closer to final exams. 

Of the ~100k, we aim to obtain 10k users within a year. 

The main self-reported hinderances in high school studies are shown in figure below. 
- Lack motivation because doesn't know how their efforts translate to results
- Are motivated and great students, want to do slightly better
- Haven't studied in ages, need help to guide through the process of zero to master
- Want a quick way to recap knowledge while riding a bus
    
## Competition

Direct competition:
- digitalized learning environments (Studea)
- prep course schools

Indirect competition:
- Free study content (opetus.tv, matikkamatskut)
- Teachers teaching in schools

Koppi:
Low barrier of use
- freemium model, monthly subscription, 
Ease of use
Learns what student knows
Familiar app

- Features include
    - price , Benefits , Quality , Durability , Image/style , Service , Warranties , Convenience , Ease of Use , # of features , Type of features , Wow factor , Location(s) , Distribution/Sales , Certifications , Endorsements
- "Benefits sell, features tell"

## Future products

- Data driven
The app gives us a lot of data. We are able to use it in our R&D when implementing better models to aid student learning. It guides creation of content.
- International markets

# Execution
## Marketing and sales plan

### Pricing

Freemium model. Limited amount of study content. Rough sketch of what student knows and what's next. Mainly to show "Look what you'd get if you'd pay us this tiny amount of money".

10€/month for all content. Free in the beginning phase when we're still in the testing phase: developing UI, algorithms, study content. Use obtained test data to guide our next efforts.

Once we have a ton of data and more hands, we are able to create "AI teachers". Increasingly good models can be sold for some additional price.

### Promotion

Advertising in 
- high schools 
- social media used by high schoolers in general
- discussion platforms (FB, jodel, ylilauta) used by students talking about problems etc

### Strategic alliances
Collaboration with pedagogy reserach groups?

### Operations
- Technology
- Distribution (web app etc)

- 

### Milestones and metrics
- Traction: evidence of early success, more than idea
- Metrics: what metrics are we following

- Traction: doesn't exist yet. Give or take a few weeks to get data.

- Metrics:
    - include
        - how often people use it
        - what portion of people stumble register
        - what portion of registering users become paying users
        - % of high schoolers
        - % of admitted uni students
    - many can be obtained real-time in the app, used to change our course
    


### Key assumptions and risks

- People want a 
    - personalized learning experience
    - don't know what to study next
    - don't know how good they are
- Risks
    - Big player starts developing their own copy
